\title{Evaluation of decision tree nodes}
\usage{
Compute.Model(tree, utilities, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{initial tree structure with utilities in its leafs.}

\item{utilities}{data.table with ordered columns containing the values of utilities.}

\item{weights}{weights for the decision model.}
}
\value{
data.table structure containing the utilities of the model for every level the decision
tree.
}
\description{
Evaluation of decision tree nodes. All the MAUT model is computed at every level 
the utilities are computed considering the given weights.
}
\details{
The whole decision model can be computed a any level and represented in a table format.
