}
\arguments{
\item{file}{standardize file with definitions.}

\item{script}{output script where the utility functions are defined automatically.}

\item{lines}{number lines to read in \code{file}.}

\item{skip}{to read the \code{file} it had to \code{skip} a given number of lines.}

\description{
Builds utility functions from definition standard.
}
\details{
The basic MAUT models are built with functions of constant absolute risk aversion, 
this functions could be defined with simple parameters, only is necessary a function name and
the domain of definition of every function and more important is necessary no more than three
coefficients for the function definition.
