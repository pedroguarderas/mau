\description{
Provides functions for the creation, evaluation and test of decision models based in
Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT).
}
\details{
MAUT models are defined employing a decision tree where similarity relations between 
different index utilities are defined, this helps to group utilities following a criteria of 
similarity. Each final node has an utility and weight associated, the utility of any internal 
node in the decision tree is computed by adding the weighted sum of eaf of its final nodes. In a 
model with \eqn{n} indexes, a criteria is composed by \eqn{C \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}}, the 
respective utility is given by:

\deqn{ \sum_{i \in C}^n w_i u_i( x_i ) }

Currently, each utility is defined like a piecewise risk aversion utility, those functions are 
of the following form:
\deqn{a x + b}
or
\deqn{a e^{cx} + b}
  
The current capabilities of \pkg{mau} are:
\enumerate{
  \item Read a list of risk aversion utilities defined in a standardized format.
  \item Evaluate utilities of a table of indexes.
  \item Load decision trees defined in column standard format.
  \item Compute criteria utilities and weights for any internal node of the decision tree.
  \item Simulate weights employing Dirichlet distributions under addition constraints in weights.
