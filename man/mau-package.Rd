\description{
Build and test decision models employing Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). Automatic 
evaluation of utilities at any level of the decision tree, weight simulations for sensitivity 
analysis.
 
MAUT models are based in a decision tree where similarity relations between different index 
utilities are defined, this helps to group utilities following a criteria of similarity. 
The global utility can be computed as a linear combination of given weights and the utility of 
each index for any other level of the decision tree the utility can be computed by local linear 
combitation of weights and child index utilities.
}
\details{
Risk aversion utilites, are linear functions of the form:
 \deqn{ a x + b}
or exponential form 
 
\deqn{ a e^{cx} + b}

\deqn{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i u_i( x_i ) }
  
The current capabilities of the mau are:
\enumerate{
  \item Read list of risk aversion utilities defined in an standardized format.
  \item Evaluate utilities of a table of indexes.
  \item Load decision trees defined in column standard.
  \item Compute internal criteria utilities for a decision tree.
  \item Simulate weights, under criteria constraints.
}
