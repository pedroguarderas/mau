Encoding: UTF-8
Date: 2018-01-17
Description: Provides functions for the creation, evaluation and test of decision models based in
    Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). Can process and evaluate local risk aversion utilities
    for a set of indexes, compute utilities and weights for the whole decision tree defining the
    decision model and simulate weights employing Dirichlet distributions under addition constraints 
    in weights.
    Also includes other rating analysis methods as for example the Colley, Offensive - Defensive 
    ratings and the ranking aggregation with Borda count.
